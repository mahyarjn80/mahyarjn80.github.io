Hey there! Welcome to my website. I'm a first-year PhD student  in [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS)](https://idss.mit.edu) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), advised by  [Professor Ali Jadbabaie](https://jadbabaie.mit.edu/). I am also affilated with the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/). Prior to coming to MIT, I was an undergraduate student at Sharif University of Technology studying Electrical Engineering.

 <!-- and had a wonderful internship at [ISTA](https://ist.ac.at/en/home/) under supervision of [Professor Marco Mondelli](http://marcomondelli.com/). -->


Right now, I really enjoy the following research topics:

* Networks and System Science
* Theory of Optimization and Machine Learning
* Causal Inference
* Language Modeling

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](comhttp://reddit.). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
